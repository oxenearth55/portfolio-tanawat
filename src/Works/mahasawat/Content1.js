                    <p>Mahasawat canal is a popular tourist attraction in Nakhon Pathom province, with many attractions and stores 
                        offering local products. To obtain these products, buyers need to travel to the site and purchase products 
                        directly from the stores. Traveling to Mahasawat can be inconvenient to several potential buyers, and many 
                        tourists may not be able to visit all the marketplaces in Mahasawat since these marketplaces are located 
                        relatively far from each other. Therefore, to help the locals increase their sales, it is necessary to enable 
                        easy access to these local products. This can be done through the development of an e-commerce platform for 
                        the Mahasawat marketplace. Besides, using an e-commerce platform can be difficult for many locals who have 
                        limited IT knowledge and skills. Thus, it is also crucial to consider this challenge when designing and 
                        implementing the e-commerce platform.
 </p>       
                    <p>The proposed web-based application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, react (hook), express, NodeJs and mongoDB to develop 
                        a web application. The system consists of twelve main functions, which are login, search product,
                         manage bank account, manage purchase, manage cart, checkout process, manage inventory, manage order, 
                         manage product, manage profile, manage user account, and manage shipping.

 I use nginx as the web server to deploy to cloud service in digital ocean.
Client can connect to our site communicating with https from cloudflare to digital ocean.
And we have external service from sendgrid using for sending emails.

1. The View component is used for all the UI logic of the application (user interface) <br/>
2. Controllers act as an interface between Model and View components to process all the business logic and incoming requests, manipulate data using the Model 
component and interact with the Views to render the final output.<br/>
3.  The Model component corresponds to all the data-related logic that the user works with. <br/>
