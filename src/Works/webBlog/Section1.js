                    <p>I created MyBloggy website to encourage people to share their ideas, experiences, lifestyle, and knowledge.
                        Also, I would like to practice a new skill such as redux which I learned from the Udemy course, and enhance other programming skills for both front-end and back-end at the same time.
                         Furthermore, I would like to grab the data 
                        from MyBloggy because I would like to display information related to my blogs, which I have shared in MyBloggy,
                        into the blog page on my portfolio(This website).  
                    </p>      

                    <p>The proposed web-based application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, react (hook), redux, express, NodeJs and mongoDB to develop 
                        a web application. The system consists of four main functions which are authentication, manage blog, manage comment and search blog
